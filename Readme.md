# Deploying on Android Devices
- Setup Gradle ( If your proxy has file download limit )

    - Set CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL

        Add an environment variable (system) as below: 
        
        ```sh
        Variable Name: CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL
        
        Variable Value: ../../../../resources/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
        ```
        
   - Download ["gradle-2.14.1-all.zip"](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip) file and keep it inside of "resources" folder
        
        
- Add Android as a platform.

    ```sh
    $   cordova platform add android
    ```
    
- Make Android Build

    ```sh
    $   ionic cordova build android --prod
    ```
     
   It will create APK at "platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug". "prod" flag will create a production apk which will be smaller. App will load faster beacuse of this flag. Don't try "release" flag during development. It will create corrupted APK.

    Use this APK to install this app.
